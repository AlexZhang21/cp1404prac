## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

Throughout this course, I have learned several important lessons about writing clean code:

1. **About"Naming"**: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to make the code more understandable and maintainable.
2. **About"Comments and Documentation"**: Provide clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and behavior of code, as well as using docstrings for functions and classes.
3. **About"Code Structure"**: Use appropriate whitespace, indentation, and line breaks to make the code more readable, and follow established language conventions and style guides.
